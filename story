Once upon a time there lived a monkey who resided on a Berry tree which was on the banks of a river. In the same forest there lived a crocodile and his wife. The monkey wanted to make a cloth for himself using the crocodile's skin, so he started trying to befriend the crocodile by feeding him. He feeded him delicious berries and the crocodile liked it. After some time, the monkey started poisoning the berries.
